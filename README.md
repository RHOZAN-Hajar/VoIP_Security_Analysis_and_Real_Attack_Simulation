# ToIP_Security_Analysis_and_Real_Attack_Simulation
Title: ToIP Security Analysis and  Real Attack Simulation
Description: Conducted an in-depth analysis of security challenges in ToIP systems. Simulated real-world attacks such as ARP spoofing, sniffing (using Wireshark and Cain), and port mirroring to identify vulnerabilities and assess associated risks, using practical tools and methodologies for cybersecurity testing and mitigation.
Skills Acquired: Network security analysis, ToIP attack simulation, expertise in security tools (Wireshark, Cain,3CX Management console server and phone).
